# Asset Includes Check Action

This GitHub Action verifies that all vendor and node_modules assets referenced in source code are included in the `.distfiles` manifest for distribution.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Detects missing PHP, JavaScript, and CSS files from `vendor/` and `node_modules/`
- ‚úÖ Supports glob patterns (`**/*`, `*.ext`, `*`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Smart minification detection: warns (but doesn't fail) when non-minified assets have minified versions
- üö® Fails only on genuinely missing assets
- üì¶ Works with asset systems that auto-swap to minified versions in production

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```yaml
name: Asset Check

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  check-assets:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ./.github/actions/asset-check
```

### With Custom Working Directory

If your `.distfiles` is not in the repository root:

```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/asset-check
  with:
    working-directory: ./common
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `working-directory` | Directory containing `.distfiles` | No | `.` |

## How It Works

### Detection Patterns

The action searches for these patterns in PHP and JavaScript files:

- `wp_enqueue_script()` and `wp_enqueue_style()`
- `require` and `include` statements
- `Asset::add()`, `tec_asset()`, `tec_assets()`
- Array-style asset definitions: `[ 'handle', 'vendor/path/file.js', [...] ]`

### Smart Minification Handling

When a non-minified asset (e.g., `vendor/tooltipster/tooltipster.bundle.js`) is found but the minified version (`vendor/tooltipster/tooltipster.bundle.min.js`) is covered in `.distfiles`:

**Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning (build passes)
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  NOTICE: The following assets reference non-minified files,
but minified versions are in ./.distfiles.
This is OK if your asset system auto-swaps to minified versions in production:

vendor/tooltipster/tooltipster.bundle.js
```

### Real Failures

When assets are genuinely missing (or PHP files without coverage):

**Result:** üö® Failure (build fails)
```
üö® ASSET INCLUDES CHECK FAILED: Assets loaded from 'vendor/' or 'node_modules/'
are missing from ./.distfiles.

vendor/freemius/start.php
```

## Exit Codes

- **0**: All assets covered (warnings are OK)
- **1**: Missing assets detected (fails CI)

## Example Output

### Successful Build (with warnings)
```
üîç Running .distfiles linting check...
--------------------------------------------------------
‚ö†Ô∏è  NOTICE: The following assets reference non-minified files,
but minified versions are in ./.distfiles.
This is OK if your asset system auto-swaps to minified versions in production:

vendor/jquery-tribe-timepicker/jquery.timepicker.js
vendor/tooltipster/tooltipster.bundle.css
--------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ Distfiles check passed: All tracked vendor/node_modules assets are listed.
```

### Failed Build
```
üîç Running .distfiles linting check...
--------------------------------------------------------
üö® ASSET INCLUDES CHECK FAILED: Assets loaded from 'vendor/' or 'node_modules/'
are missing from ./.distfiles.
Please add these **exact paths** or covering glob patterns to your ./.distfiles file:

vendor/freemius/start.php
vendor/datatables/datatables.js
--------------------------------------------------------
```

## Troubleshooting

### False Positives

If you're getting warnings for assets that are intentionally not minified, you can either:

1. Add the exact path to `.distfiles`
2. Accept the warning (it won't fail the build)

### Script Not Found

Ensure the script is executable and located at:
```
.github/scripts/check-asset-includes.sh
```

The action automatically runs `chmod +x` but the file must exist in the repository.

## Local Testing

Test the check locally before pushing:

```bash
# From repository root
bash .github/scripts/check-asset-includes.sh
```

## Requirements

- Bash shell (available on all GitHub-hosted runners)
- Standard POSIX tools: `sed`, `awk`, `grep`, `find`
