## Specs and planning

Work on this repository is planned before it is written, using
[OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec). **This is enforced** — every
pull request is checked for a plan.

Plans do not live here. A TEC feature routinely spans several repositories, so a
spec kept in one of them is invisible from the others. They all live in one shared
store instead: [`the-events-calendar/plans`](https://github.com/the-events-calendar/plans).

### First time only

```bash
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec
git clone git@github.com:the-events-calendar/plans.git ~/repos/tec-plans
openspec store register ~/repos/tec-plans --id tec-plans
```

The clone path is yours to choose. The `--id` is not — every command refers to the
store as `tec-plans`.

### Working on a ticket

1. **Create the change before writing code**, named after the ticket:
   `openspec new change SOFT-1234 --store tec-plans --description "what this does"`
2. Write the proposal, then commit and push it in the plans repo.
3. Branch as usual: `feat/SOFT-1234/short-desc`.
4. Implement. If the work shows the plan was wrong — it often does — update the
   change rather than letting the plan and the code drift apart.
5. Open the PR. The template asks for the change ID, and CI checks the plan exists
   and is still active.

Every `openspec` command takes `--store tec-plans`. There is no default and no
repo-side link, so omitting it writes the change into whatever repository you
happen to be standing in.

### Where the rest is written down

This section covers what is specific to working here. The
[`tec-openspec` skill](https://github.com/the-events-calendar/skills) covers the
workflow itself — writing a proposal worth reviewing, keeping it current, and
archiving it once (after the last repository merges, not per repo). Install it with:

```
/plugin marketplace add the-events-calendar/skills
/plugin install tec
```
