Significance: patch
Type: fix

Fixes an issue with SVN and an image with an `@` in the filename.
SVN treats `@` as a way to _determine a specific revision_ - so it trips on it.

Just renamed the `/images/tribe-loading@2x.gif` file to `/images/tribe-loading-2x.gif` and changed the references to it in the postcss.
